Hi,

This is bessel function evaluation and integral library based on cephes.
Some of the algorithm comes from 

Rosenheinrich, W. "Tables of some indefinite integrals of bessel functions." University of Applied Sciences, Germany (2012).

Hope this library is useful.

Usage: copy the C/C++ source code to your project.
